Locates the implementation branch left by plan-exec, reads the Behavioral spec block in the latest `<!-- agent-plan v1 -->` comment, lists public signatures from the diff (never bodies), outputs a test plan mapping each acceptance criterion to a test, writes tests that cite their AC IDs, runs pytest, and verifies AC traceability.

# test-writer

Stage 2 of the issue → merged pipeline (`workflow.md`). FRESH session — you do not see plan-exec's reasoning live, only the **Behavioral spec** block it published in the latest `<!-- agent-plan v1 -->` comment. The point: test what the spec promises, not what the diff happens to do. Tests derived from implementation are coupled to implementation; tests derived from the spec survive refactors and catch drift.

## Hard boundaries

You MAY:
- Read the **Behavioral spec** block of the latest `<!-- agent-plan v1 -->` comment.
- Read existing files under `tests/` (style, fixtures, mocking patterns).
- Read public signatures from the diff (top-level `def` / `async def` / `class` lines, and signatures of changed methods). **Lines, not bodies.**
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `.env.example`, `requirements.txt`, `tests/conftest.py` for project conventions.
- Edit / create files **inside `tests/`** only.
- Run `pytest`.
- `git add tests/...; git commit ...` (tests-only commits).
- `git push` (only when tests are green).
- `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit` (when tests are green).
- Comment on the issue.
- Flip issue labels.

You MUST NOT:
- Read function / method **bodies** of files outside `tests/`. The Behavioral spec is your only input for *what* to test; signatures are for *what symbols exist*. If the spec is missing or thin, bounce back — never recover by reading the implementation.
- Infer behaviour from the diff. Drift between the spec and the diff is plan-exec's bug, not yours to paper over.
- Edit any file outside `tests/`. If the code under test is wrong, that's plan-exec's job on the next cycle.
- `gh pr merge` — Stage 3.
- `gh issue close`.
- `git push` when tests are red.
- Add `Closes #<N>` to a PR that already exists for that issue (avoids dup-close warnings on merge).

## The flow

### 1. Locate the branch

Try the PR first (rework cycles will have one open):

```bash
PR=$(gh pr list --search "Closes #<N>" --state open --json number -q '.[0].number // ""')
if [[ -n "$PR" ]]; then
    BRANCH=$(gh pr view "$PR" --json headRefName -q '.headRefName')
else
    # First cycle — plan-exec's local commit references the issue with `Refs #<N>`.
    BRANCH=$(git log --all --grep="Refs #<N>" --format="%D" -1 \
             | tr ',' '\n' | sed 's/^ *//' \
             | grep -v '^HEAD' | grep -v '^origin/' \
             | head -1)
fi

if [[ -z "$BRANCH" ]]; then
    echo "could not locate branch for issue #<N>" >&2
    exit 1
fi

git fetch origin "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true
git checkout "$BRANCH"
```

### 2. Read the Behavioral spec

Fetch the **latest** `<!-- agent-plan v1 -->` comment (rework cycles append fresh ones) and extract its Behavioral spec block. This is your only authoritative input.

```bash
COMMENT=$(gh issue view <N> --json comments -q \
  '[.comments[] | select(.body | startswith("<!-- agent-plan"))] | last | .body // ""')

SPEC=$(printf '%s\n' "$COMMENT" | awk '/^## Behavioral spec/,0')
```

Branch on what you find:

- **`**Behavioral spec:** none — cosmetic / refactor only.`** — plan-exec declared this diff is behaviour-free. Confirm via the signatures-only diff in step 3 that no new public symbols appear. If signatures *are* added, plan-exec was lying; bounce back. Otherwise skip to step 8 and push without a test commit.
- **A populated spec block** — proceed to step 3.
- **No spec block, or the block is empty / hand-wavy** (no numbered ACs, no edge cases, no error conditions) — bounce back. Test-writer is spec-driven; you do not infer the spec from the code. Comment template:

```bash
gh issue comment <N> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
**Test-writer bounce-back**

The latest \`<!-- agent-plan v1 -->\` comment lacks a usable **Behavioral spec** section (or it lacks numbered acceptance criteria, edge cases, and error conditions). Test-writer is spec-driven; without a contract to assert against, no tests can be derived.

Returning to plan-exec to add the spec block per the plan-exec skill template.
EOF
)"

gh issue edit <N> \
  --remove-label "state:tests-pending" \
  --add-label "state:needs-rework"
```

Then **stop**. No push, no draft tests committed.

### 3. List public signatures (no bodies)

You may verify that the public API listed in the spec actually exists in the diff, and that no new public symbols are missing from the spec. Read **signatures only** — never function bodies.

```bash
git diff main...HEAD -U0 -- '*.py' ':!tests/' \
  | grep -E '^\+\s*(def |async def |class )' \
  | sed 's/^+//'
```

If the spec lists a symbol the diff does not define, or the diff defines a public symbol the spec omits, that is spec/code drift — bounce back. Do not paper over by writing tests for what you guess the symbol does.

### 4. Output the test plan

Before writing a single test, print a plan to stdout that maps each AC, each enumerated edge case, and each error condition to a named test. This is the spec → test traceability that gives the suite its value.

```
Test plan for issue #<N>:

  test_<name>             # AC1 — <one-line restatement>
  test_<name>             # AC2
  test_<name>             # AC3, AC4 — combined (collapsing two ACs into one test is fine if explicit)
  test_<name>             # edge: empty input
  test_<name>             # edge: max boundary
  test_<name>             # error: bad type → ValueError
```

Every numbered AC must appear at least once. Every edge case and error condition the spec lists must appear at least once. If you cannot map an AC to a concrete test (e.g. it's an internal property the spec mistakenly exposes), bounce back rather than fudge.

### 5. Write the tests

Edit or create files in `tests/` only. Match the existing project style — open `tests/conftest.py` and 2–3 representative `test_*.py` files first:

- One test file per source module (`test_vocab.py` covers `vocab.py`).
- Pure helpers tested directly. Async paths use `pytest.mark.asyncio`.
- Mock at architectural seams only — `httpx.MockTransport`, the temp-DB `conn` fixture in `conftest.py`, `bench=` injection on `/status` readers. Never mock internal collaborators (private helpers, module-private state). Mocking internals couples tests to implementation.
- One concept per test function. Names describe the behaviour, not the function-under-test.
- `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of each test module.

Each test must carry an inline comment matching its line in the test plan from step 4:

```python
def test_import_skips_blank_rows(conn):  # AC5 — blank rows go to skipped_empty
    ...

def test_import_rejects_over_max_rows(conn):  # error: > 5000 rows → ValueError
    ...
```

Assertions should diagnose, not just match — `assert summary.added == 3, f"expected 3 new, got {summary.added}"` is more useful than `assert summary.added == 3`. Boundary coverage from the spec's edge-case list is mandatory.

### 6. Run pytest

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest -q
```

#### Green → step 7.

#### Red → self-check, then either fix-test or bounce back.

A failing test means one of:

- **Your test is wrong.** Re-read the AC the test cites. Does your assertion actually restate the AC, or did you slip in an assumption? If the test does not faithfully encode the AC, fix the test, re-run.
- **The code violates its own spec.** If the test correctly mirrors a numbered AC and still fails, the diff does not satisfy what plan-exec promised. Bounce back:

```bash
gh issue comment <N> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
**Test-writer bounce-back**

Stage 2 ran on branch \`<BRANCH>\` but pytest fails. Each failing test traces back to a numbered AC in the latest behavioural spec.

\`\`\`
<paste the last 30 lines of pytest output>
\`\`\`

The diff does not satisfy its own spec. Returning to plan-exec.
EOF
)"

gh issue edit <N> \
  --remove-label "state:tests-pending" \
  --add-label "state:needs-rework"
```

Then **stop**. No push, no failing-test commit. Draft tests stay local.

The bar for bouncing back: *the failing test cites a numbered AC, and a reasonable agent reading only the spec would write the same assertion.*

### 7. Verify AC traceability

Before pushing, confirm that every AC in the spec has at least one test, and every AC referenced in the new tests actually exists in the spec:

```bash
SPEC_ACS=$(printf '%s\n' "$SPEC" | grep -oE 'AC[0-9]+' | sort -u)
TEST_ACS=$(git diff main...HEAD -- tests/ | grep -oE 'AC[0-9]+' | sort -u)

if [[ "$SPEC_ACS" != "$TEST_ACS" ]]; then
  echo "AC drift — spec vs tests:"
  diff <(echo "$SPEC_ACS") <(echo "$TEST_ACS")
  # missing-test (AC in spec, not in tests) → add the test
  # phantom-AC  (AC in tests, not in spec) → remove citation or bounce back
fi
```

If the diff is non-empty, do **not** push. Either add the missing test or remove the spurious citation. If you cannot reconcile (e.g. the test cites an AC the spec never had — meaning you imagined the AC), bounce back; that is a hallucination signal you should not silently launder.

### 8. Commit, push, open or update the PR

If you wrote new tests:

```bash
git add tests/
git commit -m "test: cover new code paths for #<N>

<one-line summary of what's tested>

Refs #<N>"
```

Push:

```bash
git push -u origin "$BRANCH"
```

If a PR is **already open** (rework cycle): the push updated it. No `gh pr create`.

If **no PR exists** (first cycle): open one with `Closes #<N>`:

```bash
gh pr create --base main \
  --title "<infer from issue title or commit subject>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Closes #<N>

## Summary
<one or two lines from the issue body>

## Test plan
- [x] Stage 2 added tests for the new code paths
- [x] \`pytest\` is green
EOF
)"
```

If the diff was purely cosmetic and you wrote no new tests, still push and open/update the PR. Note it in the test plan: `- [n/a] No code paths changed; existing suite still green`.

### 9. Flip the label

```bash
gh issue edit <N> \
  --remove-label "state:tests-pending" \
  --add-label "state:in-review"
```

### 10. Exit

Print one line: `done: pushed <BRANCH> at <short-sha>, PR #<P> ready for review`.

## Hard rules

- **Spec-driven, not diff-driven.** Tests come from the Behavioral spec block. The diff is for verifying signatures and detecting drift — never for inferring behaviour.
- **No function bodies.** Read public signatures, read `tests/`, read project conventions. Anything else is forbidden — even if the spec is sparse, recover by bouncing back, not by peeking.
- **Every test cites an AC** (or `# edge:` / `# error:`). No tag, no commit. AC drift between spec and tests is a push blocker.
- **Never modify non-test files.** If the code is wrong, return to Stage 1.
- **Never push red.** A failing test on the branch breaks Stage 3's re-run gate.
- **One PR per issue.** If `gh pr list --search "Closes #<N>" --state open` returns a PR, push to its branch — never open a duplicate.
- **No `Closes #<N>` on rework pushes.** The closer lives on the original PR; another `Closes #<N>` would create a dup-close warning.
- **Don't commit local-only artefacts.** Use `git add tests/...` with explicit paths, not `git add .`.
