name: plan-exec
description: Stage 1 of the autonomous pipeline. Runs headless from scripts/agent-plan-exec.sh on a single GitHub issue that is unlabelled (fresh), at state:needs-planning, state:needs-rework, or state:in-progress (resume). Reads the issue + any prior PR review comments, decides whether user input is needed (invoke clarify-issue if so), then follows dev-flow to cut a branch, post a `<!-- agent-plan v1 -->` comment that pairs intent with a behavioural spec, implement the change, smoke-test, and commit. Does NOT push, does NOT open a PR — those are Stage 2 (test-writer). Hands off by flipping the label to state:tests-pending.
version: 1.3.0

# plan-exec

Stage 1 of the issue → merged pipeline (see `workflow.md`). One Claude session, plan + implement combined. Expects to be invoked headless via `scripts/agent-plan-exec.sh <issue#>` — no human is in the loop.

## Hard boundaries

You MAY:
- Read code, edit code, write new files.
- `git checkout`, `git branch`, `git commit` (locally only).
- Run `pytest` for smoke checks.
- Comment on the issue (`gh issue comment`).
- Flip issue labels (`gh issue edit`).

You MUST NOT:
- `git push` — that's Stage 2 (test-writer).
- `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit` — Stage 2.
- `gh pr merge` — Stage 3 (reviewer).
- `gh issue close` — happens automatically when the reviewer merges (via `Closes #N` in the PR body).

## The flow

### 1. Read everything

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json number,title,body,labels,author,comments
```

If the issue is at `state:needs-rework`, also fetch the PR's review comments — they're the spec for this cycle:

```bash
PR=$(gh pr list --search "Closes #<N>" --state all --json number -q '.[0].number')
[[ -n "$PR" ]] && gh pr view "$PR" --json comments,reviews,headRefName
```

### 2. Verify state and flip to in-progress

The valid starting states are:
- **unlabelled** — fresh issue, never picked up. Treat exactly like `state:needs-planning`. The runner script accepts this as the equivalent of "fresh".
- `state:needs-planning` — explicitly labelled fresh.
- `state:needs-rework` — coming back from a Stage-2 bounce or Stage-3 rejection.
- `state:in-progress` — **resume**. The previous dispatch either parked for clarification (now answered — see the latest non-agent comment) or crashed mid-stream. Pick up where you stopped: do **not** restart from step 1, do **not** re-create a branch that already exists. Skip ahead — see "Resuming at `state:in-progress`" below.

Flip to in-progress (no-op if already there):

```bash
gh issue edit <N> \
  --remove-label "state:needs-planning,state:needs-rework" \
  --add-label "state:in-progress"
```

`gh` silently ignores `--remove-label` for labels not present, so the same command works whether the issue was unlabelled, `state:needs-planning`, `state:needs-rework`, or already `state:in-progress`.

**Resuming at `state:in-progress`.** Read all issue comments first. Use the prior progress signals to decide what to skip:
- `<!-- agent-plan v1 -->` present — your behavioural spec is already posted; do not re-post. Re-read it as your contract.
- A `**Clarification needed before proceeding**` comment from clarify-issue, followed by a non-agent reply — the question has been answered. Treat the reply as additional spec.
- A local branch matching `<type>/<topic>` already exists → check it out (`git checkout <branch>`) instead of cutting a new one. If the branch exists only on disk and not on the remote (clarify-issue parks before push), continue committing to it locally.

If none of the above signals exist, the prior dispatch crashed before posting anything substantive. Treat as a fresh `state:needs-planning` cycle.

### 3. Decide: clarify or proceed?

Invoke `clarify-issue` only when:
- The body is silent on a behaviour choice that **materially changes the diff** (e.g. "should the new field be nullable?").
- Two reasonable interpretations of the body lead to different module changes.
- The change is too large for one focused PR (~300 LOC, one area). Ask the user to split.
- A code constraint collides with what the body asks for (existing schema, FSRS invariant, etc.).

Do NOT clarify for:
- Naming choices — pick what matches the codebase.
- Small implementation details — make the most reasonable call.
- Anything answerable by reading more code or `CLAUDE.md`.

The bar: *would another reasonable agent make a different decision here that would survive into a different PR shape?*

### 4. Branch

**First cycle (`state:needs-planning`):**

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b <type>/<topic>
```

`<type>` comes from the `type:*` label (`feat` / `fix` / `chore` / `refactor`). If absent, infer from the change kind and add the label:

```bash
gh issue edit <N> --add-label "type:fix"
```

`<topic>` is a kebab-case summary of the issue title, ~3–5 words.

**Rework cycle (`state:needs-rework`):**

```bash
BRANCH=$(gh pr view "$PR" --json headRefName -q '.headRefName')
git fetch origin "$BRANCH"
git checkout "$BRANCH" && git pull --ff-only
```

### 5. Apply missing labels

The issue should carry `type:*`, `priority:*`, and ideally `area:*`. Add what's missing:

- `priority:medium` is the default if absent.
- `area:*` matches the modules you'll touch.

```bash
gh issue edit <N> --add-label "<comma,separated,labels>"
```

### 6. Post the plan + behavioural spec

Before writing any code, post a single issue comment with two halves:

- **Plan** — your reasoning. Stage 2 reads it for orientation; Stage 3 deliberately ignores it.
- **Behavioral spec** — the contract Stage 2 derives every test from. Test-writer is spec-driven and is forbidden from reading function bodies, so this section is its only input. A vague spec produces vague tests; an absent spec bounces the issue back to you.

The comment **must** start with the marker line `<!-- agent-plan v1 -->`. The marker is what test-writer searches for and what review-pr filters out.

```bash
gh issue comment <N> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<!-- agent-plan v1 -->
## Plan

**Goal:** <one-sentence restatement of what the issue asks>

**Approach:** <one paragraph: where the change lives, why this shape over alternatives>

**Files to change:**
- `<path>` — <what changes there>
- ...

**Out of scope:** <anything explicit you are NOT doing this cycle, if relevant>

## Behavioral spec

**Public API** (signatures and types only — no bodies):
- `module.func(arg: Type, ...) -> ReturnType` — one-line purpose
- raises `ExceptionType` when ...

**Acceptance criteria** (numbered; tests cite these IDs):
- AC1: <given X, when Y, then Z>
- AC2: <invariant — never observe state where ...>

**Edge cases:**
- empty / single / many / boundary (max, off-by-one)
- null / missing / malformed input
- unicode, whitespace, leading-trailing

**Error conditions:**
- <input> → <exception type / failure mode>

**Examples** (input → output pairs):
- f("") → ...
EOF
)"
```

Length guide: Plan half ≤ 15 lines, Behavioral spec half ≤ 25 lines. A plan that reads like a transcript is useless; a spec that hand-waves is worse. Enumerate edge cases — empty / single / many / boundary / null / unicode — before writing a line of code, even if some end up not applying.

**Cosmetic / refactor escape hatch.** When the diff genuinely changes no behaviour (docstring tweaks, comment fixes, whitespace, a no-op rename), replace the entire Behavioral spec block with the single line `**Behavioral spec:** none — cosmetic / refactor only.`. Test-writer treats that line as authoritative permission to skip test creation. Do not abuse this — if there is any new code path, the full spec is mandatory.

On rework cycles post a *new* comment (do not edit prior ones); test-writer reads the latest, and the older plans stay as history.

### 7. Implement

Follow the `dev-flow` skill. Specifically:
- Keep the diff focused on this issue's scope.
- Match the project's module layout — `bot.py` is wiring; logic lives in `vocab.py`, `llm.py`, `scheduler.py`, etc.
- Keep helpers pure and injectable. Test seams matter for Stage 2.
- Update `.env.example` and the env table in `CLAUDE.md` if you add a new variable.
- If you add, rename, or remove a slash command, update `COMMANDS` in `bot.py` (drives `/help` and Telegram's `set_my_commands`), the `HELP_TEXT` getting-started prose if user flow changes, and the `CLAUDE.md` Bot commands table — otherwise the feature is invisible in the bot UI.

**Do NOT write tests yourself.** Stage 2 (test-writer) writes the tests in a fresh session. You write the implementation only. The exception: if existing tests need updating because behaviour legitimately changed, update them as part of your commit.

### 8. Smoke check

Before committing, prove the code at least compiles and existing tests still pass:

```bash
python -m py_compile $(git diff --name-only main -- '*.py')
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest -q
```

If existing tests now fail, fix the code (not the tests) until the suite is green. New-code-path coverage is Stage 2's job, not yours.

### 9. Commit

One focused commit. Subject ≤ 70 chars, imperative mood. Body explains the why. End the body with `Refs #<N>` (not `Closes #<N>` — Stage 2's PR carries the closer).

```bash
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<imperative subject>

<one-paragraph why>

Refs #<N>
EOF
)"
```

Don't `git add -A` or `git add .` — name the files you changed to avoid pulling in stray local artefacts.

### 10. Hand off

```bash
gh issue edit <N> \
  --remove-label "state:in-progress" \
  --add-label "state:tests-pending"
```

Print one summary line and exit:

```
done: <branch-name> at <short-sha>, ready for test-writer
```

## Rework specifics

When invoked at `state:needs-rework`:
- The PR is already open. The branch is on origin. Make new commits, **don't amend** earlier ones — the test-writer will push them as the PR's next push.
- Treat the reviewer's comments + the original issue body together as the spec. If they conflict, that's a `clarify-issue` case — the user resolves.
- Don't open a new PR. The existing one picks up your commits when Stage 2 pushes.

## Escalating to state:blocked

You generally don't set `state:blocked` — that's reserved for the orchestrator (cycle limit) and the reviewer (safety triggers). The exception: the issue requests something genuinely impossible (referenced model/file/API doesn't exist).

```bash
gh issue comment <N> --body "Cannot proceed: <reason>"
gh issue edit <N> --remove-label "state:in-progress" --add-label "state:blocked"
```

## What "done" looks like

- A branch with one new commit on it.
- Smoke tests pass on that commit.
- Issue is at `state:tests-pending`.
- No `git push`. No PR. No merge.
